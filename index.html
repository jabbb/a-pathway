                <p>Starting in New York, USA, this pathway leads across grass and dirt and rock, from continent to continent, computer to computer, pixel to pixel. Each "plot" was purchaced on Amazon Mechanical Turk for $0.10 USD from internet users all around the world, each indevidual instructed to take a picture of the ground at their feet such that it visual matched the previous piece. Feel free to take a scroll and see where it leads</p>
